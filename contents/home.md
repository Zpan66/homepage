As an student in Applied Math and Statistics, I love finding structure in messy problems. Whether it’s patterns in numbers or ideas in data, I’m drawn to the logic and clarity that math and statistics can bring. I enjoy working with data, building models, and thinking through how things work—especially when math meets real-world questions. I'm always curious, always learning, and excited about where applied math and computing can take me next.
